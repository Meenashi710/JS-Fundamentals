Exercise: Student Grade Evaluation
You are tasked with evaluating the grades of students based on their scores. Each student has the following properties:

Name
Score (out of 100)
The students are:

Student 1: Name - "Alice", Score - 85
Student 2: Name - "Bob", Score - 92
Student 3: Name - "Charlie", Score - 78
Student 4: Name - "David", Score - 88
Your tasks are:
Store these students in an array of objects.
Determine which student has a score greater than or equal to 90 and print their name.
Check if each studentâ€™s score is above or below the average score of the group and print whether they performed above or below average.
Print a message indicating if any student scored exactly 80.
Requirements:
Use objects to represent the students.
Store the objects in an array.
Utilize relational operators (>, <, >=, <=) and equality operators (===, !==) to perform comparisons and evaluations.
Print results clearly.
